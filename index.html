      <h1>HTML</h1>
      <p>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup
        language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML uses markup
        tags to structure the content on a web page and define its elements such
        as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, forms, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML documents are composed of elements, which are represented by tags
        enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; &gt;). These tags surround the content
        and give it meaning and structure. Attributes can be added to tags to
        provide additional information or control certain behaviors of the
        elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML is the backbone of web development and provides the structure and
        content of websites, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to
        define the visual appearance of these elements, and JavaScript is used
        to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="css">
      <h1>CSS</h1>
      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language used to describe
        the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS provides a
        way to specify how elements should be displayed on a webpage, including
        their layout, colors, fonts, sizes, and other visual properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        With CSS, you can create styles that can be applied to multiple elements
        or a specific group of elements. CSS rules consist of a selector and a
        set of declarations enclosed in curly braces. The selector targets the
        element(s) that you want to style, and the declarations specify the
        styles you want to apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS allows for the separation of presentation from structure and
        content, making it easier to make changes across multiple pages or even
        an entire website with a single update to the CSS file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, CSS is an essential part of web development, providing control
        over the visual aspects of webpages and allowing for more appealing and
        consistent styles across different devices and browsers.

      <h1>Javascript</h1>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is commonly used
        for web development, and it can also be used for creating a wide range
        of applications, including mobile apps and games. It is a dynamic and
        versatile language that allows developers to add interactivity and
        functionality to web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript can be used to manipulate and modify HTML elements, handle
        user interactions (such as clicks and form submissions), make HTTP
        requests to a server, perform calculations, and much more. It is often
        used alongside HTML and CSS to create dynamic and interactive web
        applications.
      </p>

      <p>Some key features of JavaScript include:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Variables and data types: JavaScript allows you to declare variables
            to store data and supports various data types such as numbers,
            strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Functions: JavaScript allows you to define reusable code blocks
            called functions. Functions can accept arguments, perform
            calculations or operations, and return a value.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Events: JavaScript can respond to user actions, such as button
            clicks or mouse movements, using event listeners. Event listeners
            enable you to bind functions to specific events and handle them
            accordingly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            DOM manipulation: JavaScript can manipulate the Document Object
            Model (DOM), which represents the structure of an HTML document. You
            can use JavaScript to add, modify, or remove HTML elements and their
            attributes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Control structures: JavaScript provides control structures like if
            statements, for loops, while loops, and switch statements, which
            enable developers to control the flow of their code based on certain
            conditions.
          </p>

      <h1>React</h1>
      <p>
        React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces,
        particularly for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
        Developed by Facebook, React.js allows developers to build reusable UI
        components that can efficiently update and render data whenever there
        are changes.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some key features and concepts in React.js:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Components: React.js is known for its component-based architecture.
            Components are reusable building blocks that encapsulate the UI's
            logic and render specific parts of the user interface. Components
            can be small and isolated, making them easier to manage and
            maintain.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Virtual DOM: React.js uses a virtual representation of the Document
            Object Model (DOM) called the Virtual DOM. The virtual DOM allows
            React to efficiently update only the necessary parts of the UI when
            there are changes, rather than re-rendering the entire page.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            JSX: React introduces JSX, a syntax extension that combines
            JavaScript and XML-like syntax. JSX makes it easier and more
            intuitive to define the structure and content of UI components,
            allowing developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Uni-directional data flow: React follows a uni-directional data
            flow, where data flows from parent components to child components
            through properties (props). This ensures that the UI remains
            consistent and predictable.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            State management: React components can have their own state, which
            is internal to the component and can be updated over time. State
            changes trigger updates to the UI, resulting in a reactive and
            interactive user experience. React provides tools like the useState
            and useReducer hooks to manage component state.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            React Router: React Router is a library that enables developers to
            handle routing and navigation in a React application. It allows for
            creating multiple pages or views within a single-page application
            and provides methods to navigate between them.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        React.js has a large and active community, and there are many
        third-party libraries and extensions available to enhance functionality
        and improve development efficiency. It is often used in conjunction with
        other libraries or frameworks, such as Redux for state management or
        Next.js for server-side rendering.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, React.js is a powerful and flexible framework for building user
        interfaces, offering a declarative and efficient approach to building
        dynamic web applications.

          <p>
            Asynchronous and non-blocking: Node.js uses an event-driven,
            non-blocking I/O model. This means that instead of blocking and
            waiting for responses from I/O operations, Node.js allows multiple
            operations to be processed simultaneously. It uses callbacks or
            Promises to handle asynchronous operations, allowing for faster and
            more efficient handling of requests.
          </p>
        </li>

          <p>
            Package management: Node.js has its own package manager called npm
            (Node Package Manager). npm allows developers to easily install,
            manage, and share reusable JavaScript code packages to streamline
            development processes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Single-threaded event loop: Node.js uses a single-threaded event
            loop model to handle concurrent requests efficiently. The event loop
            continuously checks for and dispatches pending events, making
            Node.js highly performant and able to handle a large number of
            concurrent connections.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Cross-platform compatibility: Node.js is cross-platform, which means
            it can run on various operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and
            Linux, making it highly versatile and widely adopted.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>

            provide ready-to-use functionality for various use cases, allowing
            developers to leverage existing solutions and accelerate
            development.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Node.js is often used with frameworks such as Express.js to build web
        applications, but it can also be used for other types of applications,
        including real-time applications, streaming servers, and command-line
        tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, Node.js provides a powerful and scalable runtime environment
        for server-side JavaScript development, enabling developers to build

      <h1>MongoDB</h1>
      <p>
        MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database management system that
        stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON).
        It is designed to handle large amounts of data and provide high
        performance, scalability, and flexibility for modern applications.
      </p>
      <p>Key features of MongoDB include:</p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like
            documents called BSON documents. These documents can contain arrays
            and other nested structures.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Schema-less: Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB
            doesn't require a predefined schema. Each document in a collection
            can have a different structure.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
